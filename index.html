          <h1 id="project_title">Quick Sketch Widget</h1>
          <h2 id="project_tagline">By Katie Han</h2>
          <p id="project_desc">
          The widget below is a drawing tool that can be use on various occasions,
          such as note-taking, sending an email, or posting on a social networking
          site. After opening the widget with the pencil icon, the user can
          click and drag the mouse on the canvas to quickly draw a small sketch of 
          something to communicate his or her ideas. When incorporated into SNS, 
          such as Facebook or Twitter, the 
          download button would be replaced with an upload button so that the image 
          can be posted directly. As one may expect, the download button downloads the drawn image, and the X button clears the canvas and folds it, 
          returning the interface to its original form. Small graphic icons are
          used instead of text-based buttons in order to make the widget more intuitive
          and user-friendly. Although communcation online through text and photos is 
          well-developed these days, the idea of sending quick sketches is uncommon. 
          It is a utility that would make the user experience much simpler and more convenient.
